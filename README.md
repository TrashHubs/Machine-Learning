# Machine Learning

We use tensorflow as main library that we used to develop the CNN model. And used the another library as support the preprocessing the dataset.

## Requirements

The model for this project using **python version 3.9.x** and requires importing libraries with appropriate versions :

```
tensorflow==2.13.0
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.3
scikit-learn==1.2.0
scipy==1.10.1
tensorflowjs==4.12.0 -> This Require For Convert
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please use the followin versions, using different version may can make it error.

## Detail Of Dataset

The following data set is used from Kaggle :

- [First Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification)
- [Second Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehboloori/trash-type-detection)
  And it merge into a large Dataset :

## Model Architecture

Choosing this model Architecture, after create and evaluate the model by model layer created. The final model Architecture that used :
